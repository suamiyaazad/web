<li>Bountiful,UT,</li>
<li>Last Chance,CO,</li>
<li>Why,AZ</li>

<h2>July 14,2005</h2>
<p>I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today:</p>
<blockquote>Passing cars,<br>
            when you can't see,<br>
            May get you,<br>
            A glimpse,<br>
            of eternity.<br>
</blockquote>
<p>'I definitely won't be passing any cars.</p>

<p>My first day of the trip!I can't believe I finally got everything packed and ready to go.Because I'm on a segway,I wasn't able to bring a whole lot wuth me:</p>
<ul>
    <li>cellphone,</li>
    <li>iPod,</li>
    <li>digital camera,</li>
    <li>and a protein bar.</li>
</ul>
<p>Just the essentials.As Lao Tzu would have said,"A journey of a thousand mile begins with one segway."</p>
